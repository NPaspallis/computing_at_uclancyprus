"I chose to study MSc in Computing for its challenging and dynamic study environment.
The program provides various courses from many subjects giving you the opportunity to specialize
 in your preferred areas of studies. Laboratories are well structured with extensive hands-on experience
 to prepare students for the real working world.
 Lecturers are exceptional and highly research active with valuable insights and multitude industry experience
 into many research fields.
 I would highly recommend this course to anyone who will pursue a career in a technical field or have an interest
 in the cutting-edge technologies of tomorrow."

Thanks
