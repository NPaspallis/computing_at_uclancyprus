IT Students Challenge Success

Dear all,
A while back our IT Support team had circulated an invitation by GEANT (supporting the academic networks across Cyprus) for a lightning talk challenge for networking students. There would be a National Competition and the winner would go to Austria in the Summer to represent Cyprus at the TNC2017 where our winner would join students from across Europe.
 
Since this was a networking challenge, I pitched it to our students and Ernesta Grigaityte was interested, so we entered the competition.
 
The results are in today and Ernesta was successful! This is a great achievement for her as she is representing Cyprus Networking students, and she is fully funded by GEANT.
 
Best Regards,
Josephina
