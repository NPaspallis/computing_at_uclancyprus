At UClan CY Computing I gained all the necessary knowledge to get me started on my path as a software engineer.
It was not always about learning, as I was able to experience all the other fun aspects of software engineering,
such as teamwork and critical problem 
olving. This healthy environment has allowed me to progress fast, and the experiences I gained while at
UClan CY are very helpful even today.
