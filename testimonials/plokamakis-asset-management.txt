Dear Panayiotis,
 
As we are near with the completion of the final version of the Equipment Registry System software that I asked you to prepare for the University, I would like to give you personally and the InSpire, and Savvas Adamou a big thank you for the collaboration we had in the past few months and the attention to detail you showed in undertaking this project.
 
The implementation of this system is going to be a big help to me in controlling the furniture stock of the University which up until this point it was done manually which means that we had to spent a lot of time in actually going around the campus and physically count one by one the different kind of furniture.
 
The extra features that the system provides which were added progressively throughout the set up period as a result of the discussions held between Dr Andreou, Savvas Adamou (the student) and myself, gives more flexibility and more data towards a more efficient control of the furniture stock. 
 
Thanks again to the whole InSPIRE team for the commitment and the high level of professionalism towards the completion of this project for the University.
 
Kind Regards,

George Plokamakis
