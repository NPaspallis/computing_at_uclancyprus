I found BSc (Hons) Computing to be an excellent program that exceeded my expectations. I was educated in contemporary topics in Software Engineering that are relevant and in high demand by the industry today. 
The faculty is extremely knowledgeable and genuinely concerned about the development of its students as future IT specialists. I am graduating UCLan Cyprus having received the appropriate education in my field and feeling more than confident in my ability to compete in the professional sector.
