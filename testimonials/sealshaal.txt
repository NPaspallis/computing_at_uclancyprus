Hi Dr Nearchos,
 
I agree to be featured. Recommendation sentence  [you can modify any mistakes or ambiguousness]:
 
“I believe the program gives you right tools to continue growing by yourself once the degree finishes by teaching you how to learn new materials. The academics interest and support is phenomenal and it goes beyond the lectures scope and will get you motivated to do many more things in the field.”
 
Best,
Salah
