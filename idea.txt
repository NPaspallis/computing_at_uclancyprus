1. Set up a dedicated page: computing.uclan.ac.cy
It will have these sessions:
- brief description of the program (and specializations)
- brief description of the modules
- brief description of the involved staff
- student testimonials (of graduated or graduating students)

- BCS accretidation
- student achievements (e.g. robotex)

2. I will need from marketing:
- taking pictures of staff
- taking pictures of students
- proofreading the page before going live

3. Budget to promote the page (primarily in Facebook but also via Google).

- staff and their areas
- achievements
- testimonials
